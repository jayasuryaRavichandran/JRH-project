                                        </p>
                                        <p> If you're new to the world of nitro RC car and truck racing there are a few
                                            basic terms that you will hear over and over. If you want to go on the track
                                            and look like you've been racing for years instead of some green newbie,
                                            learn these terms and learn to talk the talk! </p>
                                        <p> first term you'll need to know the full meaning of is "nitro". It refers to
                                            any fuel powered vehicle or the fuel itself which is gas mixed with the fuel
                                            additive nitromethane. The mixture of the nitro can be anywhere from 10% to
                                            40% added to the gasoline, but normally is in the 20% range.</p>
                                        <p>Another common term you'll hear a lot is "glow engine". This is the engine of
                                            your nitro RC car or truck. The engines have a glow plug (definition coming)
                                            and they work in the same fashion as a spark plug. The filament inside the
                                            plug glows when it gets hot. </p>
                                        <p>Which brings us to the next common RC car and truck term "glow plug". The
                                            glow plug heats the fuel mixture in your nitro RC car or truck and when it
                                            gets hot it begins to glow. The glow plug is heated with a battery powered
                                            glow started or glow plug warmer. Once the engine is running however, good
                                            old fashioned combustion takes over to keep the engine of your RC car or
                                            truck running. </p>
                                        <p>The fourth definition you need to know is "glow starter". This is a battery
                                            powered device that you can attach to your RC car's glow plug to heat it up
                                            to get your vehicle going. If you are running your RC car or truck outside
                                            in colder weather, this is a very handy gadget to have around.</p>
                                        <p>Now that you know the basics of the RC car and truck lingo. You can get out
                                            on the track not sound quite so new to the fun sport of RC car and truck
                                            racing! </p>
                                        <p><b>RC Nitro Car Basics </b><br>Now that you know the basic nitro RC car
                                            terms, you should also know the very basics about your RC car or truck
                                            itself. </p>
                                        <p>You will need to prep your RC car or truck before a race. Prepping a nitro RC
                                            vehicle isn't too far away from the necessary preparations you need to make
                                            to race an electric RC car. However there are a few extras that need to be
                                            done:</p>
                                        <p>Check your engine fuel settings. If this is your first race, even if your
                                            Nitro RC car said RTR (ready to run) the engine will probably still require
                                            a little breaking in. Read your manufacturer's manual to get the proper fuel
                                            settings and until you know your RC car, use those settings as the safe
                                            middle ground for running your RC vehicle. Generally, breaking in an RC
                                            nitro engine involves running your car through roughly 3 to 5 full tanks of
                                            fuel and while not hitting top speeds, using various different speeds to
                                            make sure all the gears are working. Don't overheat your RC car during
                                            break-in and take a break between runs.</p>
                                        <p>When you're done running your RC car for the day. drain the fuel tank or you
                                            run the risk of contamination to your fuel through condensation. Also make
                                            it a point to clean and oil your air filter. Adding the after-run oil to
                                            keep your RC vehicle lubricated so it will be ready to roll for the next
                                            race. </p>

                                                Ground</b><br> <small>by Ed Bridges</small> </p>
                                        <p>Every nitro RC vehicle has some sort of clutch that engages and disengages to
                                            provide power to a transmission or differential. Having this clutch working
                                            properly can mean the difference between a strong bottom end and a soft
                                            bottom end. When the clutch is engaging too early, it causes a low-end bog.
                                            The first thing most people do when this happens is to lean out the fuel/air
                                            mixture. If done to the extreme, this can shorten the lifespan of any nitro
                                            engine, as it is allowing more air and less fuel to enter the engine. The
                                            engine will run excessively hot and won't have enough oil to maintain the
                                            lubrication. I see newcomers, and even some experienced tuners, making this
                                            common mistake. If you're constantly trying to tune the engine to get bottom
                                            end, there's a good chance the clutch isn't working properly. If your nitro
                                            truck or car doesn't seem to have the bottom end it once had, or if you just
                                            want more low end power, follow the steps below to tune your clutch for
                                            maximum grunt and to get you off the line before the next guy.</p>
                                        <p><strong>HERE'S HOW</strong><br>If your engine is tuned correctly, the clutch
                                            shoes shouldn't be engaging while idling. When removing the clutch bell, pay
                                            close attention to the order in which any shims or washers were installed so
                                            that it can be reassembled the same way. </p>
                                        <p>The car idle. If it begins to move forward then your clutch is engaging too
                                            early. Check the engagement time by slowly increasing the engine rpm from
                                            idle and noticing when the car starts to move forward. I like to get 1/8
                                            throttle before the clutch shoes engage. This will vary, depending on servo
                                            and radio setup. In general, you want to be able to idle up enough that the
                                            engine has a noticeable rpm increase. If the car moves the instant you begin
                                            to increase throttle then it's engaging early. This can be beneficial on
                                            loose tracks where having too much bottom end will cause the wheels to break
                                            free when accelerating. However, most of us weekend racers and backyard
                                            bashers want axle-breaking bottom end power. Remove the engine from the car
                                            and remove the clutch bell. Pay close attention to how the clutch comes
                                            apart: how</p>
                                        <p>As the flywheel spins, the clutch shoes are forced outward to engage the
                                            clutch belt.many shims are used and where they go. There are several types
                                            of clutch systems out there. Most common on small blocks is the 2-shoe
                                            design. And the most popular for trucks and buggies seems to be a 3-shoe
                                            setup. No matter what setup you run they all work the same way centrifugal
                                            force. Remember the Gravitron at the fair? The thing that looked like a big
                                            UFO? You went inside and stood against the wall, and when it started to spin
                                            the walls rose off the ground, taking you up with them. Then, as it was
                                            spinning, you could climb around the walls like Spiderman. Well, it was
                                            centrifugal force that kept you against the wall. Did you happen to notice
                                            that as it sped up some people could lift their feet sooner than others?
                                            That represents how weight affects centrifugal force. It's the same with our
                                            flywheels: The faster the flywheel spins, the more centrifugal force that's
                                            applied to the clutch shoes. It forces them out to make contact with the
                                            clutch bell. The weight of the clutch shoes and the spring tension determine
                                            when they engage and disengage.</p> <strong>CLUTCH SHOES</strong><br>
                                        <p>A light clutch shoe will allow the clutch to engage at a higher rpm. A
                                            heavier shoe will engage earlier. You can lighten the clutch shoes by doing
                                            one of two things. You can drill holes in the side of the shoes, but do this
                                            in the same spot on each shoe. Start small, and drill another hole if
                                            needed. Or you can drill out the first hole bigger, or a combination of
                                            both. The second option is to trim the shoes on the trailing edge. Do this
                                            with a fresh blade on your hobby knife. This will give you a smooth and easy
                                            cut. Try to remove equal amounts on all the shoes.</p>
                                        <p>Removing weight from clutch shoes will allow them to engage at a higher RRPM.
                                            You can do this either by drilling a whole in each shoe or by sutting
                                            material from the trailing end with a sharp hobby knife.</p> <strong>CLUTCH
                                            SPRINGS</strong>
                                        <p>For 3- and 4-shoe clutch systems, the springs are rated from soft to hard:
                                            .9, 1.0 or even 1.1. Some just say soft, medium, or hard. On single spring
                                            clutches, the length of the spring affects the tension. A short spring will
                                            have more tension to hold the shoes back. A thicker or heavier spring will
                                            do the same. Both types will make the clutch engage at a higher rpm, similar
                                            to running a light clutch shoe. A stiff spring will also allow the clutch to
                                            disengage faster when letting off the throttle. This will let you roll
                                            through the turns without the engine wanting to pull you.</p>
                                        <p>Clutch springs, including the types shown here, will wear out over time and
                                            have the potential to break. Periodic replacement is necessary.I personally
                                            like to run 1.1 springs with stock shoes on my 3- shoe flywheel and then
                                            drill the shoes for fine tuning. Just remember that the springs do wear out
                                            and lose their tension and the shoes will become glazed, which could cause
                                            slippage. I like to change my springs every two gallons of fuel and check
                                            and replace the shoes as needed. You can remove the glaze from the shoes by
                                            lightly going over them with fine sandpaper. If your clutch bell is glazed
                                            inside with clutch shoe material, you can remove that the same way. Finding
                                            the right combination of clutch shoes and clutch springs can be time
                                            consuming, but in the end, it's well worth the effort. </p>
                                        <p>Experiment with different clutch shoes and spring combinations to find the
                                            Clutch shoes will accumulate a buildup over time. You can renew the surface
                                            with fine sandpaper. The same is true for the inside of the clutch belt.
                                            combo that best suits your driving style. Before you know it, you'll be able
                                            to buy new shoes and know exactly where to cut or drill for the performance
                                            you want. I stick with one type of spring and tune the shoes according to
                                            different track conditions.</p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHOOSING A CLUTCH BELL</span></p>
                                        <p>You can also get better acceleration by changing the clutch bell. If you are
                                            running a 14-tooth bell, you can drop to a 13 for better acceleration, but
                                            you will lose top end speed. If you're looking for more top end speed, you
                                            can increase the clutch bell size to a 15-tooth. This will give you more top
                                            end speed; however, bottom end acceleration will suffer. Something to keep
                                            in mind is the inside diameter of the clutch bell affects when the clutch
                                            engages. OFNA clutch bells have a larger inside diameter than most on the
                                            market, and they will let the clutch engage later if used on a smaller
                                            flywheel design. No matter what size clutch bell you use, the clutch shoes
                                            and springs have to be working properly to get Switching to a larger clutch
                                            bell like the one on the left will improve top end and hinder acceleration
                                            slightly. A smaller clutch bell, shown on the right, will improve low end
                                            and hinder a top end. the clutch to work right. </p>
                                        <p>After the springs and shoes have been mounted to the flywheel, it's time to
                                            reinstall your clutch bell. Reinstall it in reverse order. Did you remember
                                            where the shims went? If you are using a different bell then you may have to
                                            shim more. With the clutch bell on and tight it should spin freely. If it
                                            doesn't then it needs to be shimmed so you have minimal endplay. Endplay
                                            refers to how much the clutch bell will slide back and forth on the crank. A
                                            little play is all right, but too much will cause your clutch bell bearings
                                            to fail early. OFNA makes a clutch shim kit that has every shim you could
                                            ever use. After you get it shimmed, reinstall the engine and go rip up some
                                            dirt, grass or asphalt. </p>

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most popular subjects in RC is speed.
                                            Experienced hobbyists love to point how the only two questions the
                                            uninitiated have when they see an RC running are: how fast and how much?
                                            Going fast isn't just on the mind of newbs. Truth be told, we're all
                                            interested in going faster. Racers quickly point out that it's not how fast
                                            your car is that matters, what matters is how fast you get around the track.
                                            I know I'm guilty as charged, but if racers actually believed what they say,
                                            they wouldn't be buying latest motors, speed controls and batteries every
                                            time something hot hit the shelves. Bashers, in contrast, readily admit they
                                            have a need for speed. The bottom line is that we're all a little obsessed
                                            with speed, and more specifically, going faster. Check out these five top
                                            ways for going for faster with your electric ride. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gearing</strong> </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Changing to a larger pinion will make your car
                                            faster. Most people learn that pretty quick and odds are you already knew
                                            that. A larger pinion will also make your electronics run hotter
                                            specifically your motor and speed control. You'll also lose run time and
                                            acceleration. Pinions aren't the only gears that can be changed on most RC
                                            cars. It's often easy to swap out a spur gear. You'll need to go smaller for
                                            more speed and it's worth noting that the results will be far less
                                            noticeable per tooth count change. You can probably expect to gain 2mph from
                                            a single tooth pinion increase in most applications.</p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Increase Motor Timing</strong></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Increasing motor timing will increase rpm which
                                            in turn will result in more speed. Timing increases on brushless motors tend
                                            to yield more subtle results compared to brushed motors, but you will see
                                            positive results in both cases. You'll have to watch your motor temperature
                                            and make sure it stays below 160 degrees F. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Taller Tires</strong></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Changing tire size is like changing gearing.
                                            Taller tires cover more ground per revolution, so your car will be faster at
                                            the same motor rpm as it was with shorter tires. Off-road, the results will
                                            subtle unless you go to a really huge tire. When racing on-road,
                                            specifically with foam tires, this is an important part of race tuning. A
                                            half inch increase (pretty significant) tire diameter will yield
                                            approximately an increase of about 4 or 5mph.</p>
                                        <p style=" text-align: justify;"><strong>Higher Kv or Lower Turn Motor</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the old fashion way to get more speed
                                            add horsepower. Most brushless motors have Kv rating and the higher the Kv
                                            rating, the more rpm a motor will put out per volt. If the Kv rating isn't
                                            listed, a turn rating will often be used. With brushed and brushless motors,
                                            a lower turn rating equals more rpm. Always check the limits of your speed
                                            control before installing a "hotter" motor. Increasing your motor's Kv
                                            rating 2,200Kv can yield an increase of 20mph if your are using the same
                                            brand and model motor and have batteries that can supply the needed juice.

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">If you're only going 25mph, aerodynamics aren't
                                            going to play too noticeable of a role. If you're going 50mph, aerodynamics
                                            will certainly start becoming influential on top speed. In addition to
                                            mounting a low profile, sleek body shell, mount it as low as possible and
                                            keep the wheel wells as small as possible. Open up the rear of the body to

                                            volts can increase speed by as much as 25mph! Make sure your speed control

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">If you picked up your fuel jug to go fill your
                                            RC car and noticed droplets of water inside, stop. Those droplets of water
                                            inside a fuel jug will contaminate the fuel. It is best to safely dispose of
                                            that fuel and invest in an airtight fuel jug and there are other ways to
                                            fight the moisture problem.One of the first ways you can tell you are using
                                            fuel that has been water contaminated is your car will have degraded
                                            performance or may not start at all.</p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your RC cars fuel is made up mainly of methanol
                                            (alcohol). Methanol is hygroscopic meaning that it attracts moisture. This
                                            can cause your fuel to be contaminated with water, which will cause poor
                                            engine performance. Additionally, the UV (ultraviolet) rays in sunlight will
                                            eventually break down the nitro-methane if the fuel jug is stored in
                                            sunlight for long periods of time. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Use a metal can first off out in the field. When
                                            you store your fuel at home, squeeze all the air out of the fuel container
                                            and an even better idea is to store your fuel in smaller containers that you
                                            have removed as much air as you can before sealing. When you're racing your
                                            RC car outside, especially in warmer weather, you can all but expect
                                            condensation to happen in your fuel bottle. When you're racing, just bring
                                            the fuel you'll need for the day and leave the rest safely stored at home,
                                            this will keep your fuel supply uncontaminated by moisture and always ready
                                            to run. <b><br></b></p>

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">If you're an RC car enthusiast, you probably
                                            have read a lot of magazine articles and websites regarding car fuels.</p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> The main argue points among most people is what
                                            type of oil is needed for car fuel and how much should be used? First of
                                            all, skip the advice you got on using airplane fuel. Car engines work
                                            completely different from airplane engines. The workings are different and
                                            airplane fuel can be up to 20% oil, an RC car typically needs only 8-12%.
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">If you use fuel with a higher oil content,
                                            contrary to popular belief, it will not improve your engine life. Too much
                                            oil will actually degrade the performance of your car's engine and in some
                                            cases can lead to overheating of the engine. Keep your RC car engine running
                                            crisp at roughly 8% but no more than 12% added oil to your fuel. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The story that airplane fuel will run in your RC
                                            car better and give your engine better protection, is just that: a story.
                                            Use the fuel made for your RC car's engine and you will get a much longer
                                            life out of your RC car without the fear of damaging the internal workings
                                            of your car's engine. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Also, keep your RC car fuel tightly sealed and
                                            away from moisture as water will seriously degrade your car's fuel. If you
                                            have old fuel in your garage, toss it safely and invest in fresh fuel for
                                            your RC car, your engine is worth it! </p>

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you love to race you RC car and you live in
                                            a place where winter makes outdoor track racing impossible, you might enjoy
                                            carpet racing. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Indoor carpet racing is a great way to still be
                                            able to race your RC car or truck and not have it exposed to the elements.
                                            Mostly popular in the mid-west part of the country during the winter months,
                                            carpet racing is also gaining popularity in places where the winters are
                                            mild but the summers are blazing as an escape from the extreme heat. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Driving on carpet tracks requires different
                                            techniques for controlling your RC car as opposed to pavement or standard
                                            track racing. When you begin carpet racing with your RC car, first of all -
                                            get in all the practice you can. Do several practice laps and learn where
                                            you need to begin turning your car at each corner to avoid crashing or
                                            rolling. Your RC car will maintain a pretty good grip on the carpet track so
                                            you can push the limit and make sharper turns on a carpet track than you can
                                            on a pavement track. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Start off a little slow and then go a little
                                            faster with each successive lap. Make a note in your mind where each turning
                                            point is and then you can go out on the track and look like you've been
                                            carpet racing for years. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Use the creep method for taking on corners.
                                            Maintaining your speed around corners is easy if you let off your throttle
                                            slightly and then the resulting slight braking action will cause a weight
                                            shift to the front of the car. This lets the RC car hug the track when going
                                            around a corner and with practice you will be able to take corners faster
                                            than ever before. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> When carpet racing your RC car, the inside line
                                            is prime position. Most carpet races have stagger starts that greatly
                                            reduces the chances of the first lap pile ups that you have no doubt
                                            experienced. Most of those pile ups happen on the outside lines, go for the
                                            inside and you can normally escape the damage if someone else causes a pile
                                            up.</p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Carpet racing is a blast with your RC car, ask
                                            your local hobby shop if there's a carpet racing track near you! </p>

                                        <p>Shorter camber links, more camber gain. Lower roll center, allows car to
                                            transfer more weight side to side, raise upper camber link on tower. Less
                                            anti squat. Allows more weight transfer to the rear for more traction on
                                            power. Lighter diff fluids, allows tires to move more independently and
                                            hopefully pick up traction.</p>
                                        <p><strong>High Bite Tracks</strong></p>
                                        <p>Longer camber links. Less camber gain, chassis more flat. Higher roll center,
                                            allow less chassis roll, lower upper camber link on tower. Move shocks out
                                            on the arm, stabilizes and mellows out the car. Heavier diff fluids, won't
                                            diff out as easy, could be faster though corners and on acceleration.
                                            Stiffer springs, less chassis movement.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Track with Big Jumps Flat Landings</strong></p>
                                        <p>More pack, use smaller hole pistons or less holes to get desired pack so car
                                            doesn't bottom out so bad. Thicker shock oils to get to pack up more. Shocks
                                            out on the arms, stiffens shocks and less leverage from outside of arm.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Very Rough Track</strong></p>
                                        <p>Less Pack. Use bigger hole pistons or more holes, must make sure why car is
                                            bouncing, is it due to packing up or is it due to bottoming out. If due to
                                            packing up, use less pack, if bottoming out then perhaps need a little more
                                            pack. Lighter center diff fluid, helps to give up energy when hitting bumps
                                            and makes car more front wheel drive. Less toe while this may make the car
                                            looser it can help go through bumps in the corners without catching as bad.
                                            More droop. This is dependent on type of ruts but generally more droop can
                                            help absorb the ruts better.</p>
                                        <p>Quicker shock rebound, perhaps using stiffer springs or a tapered piston to
                                            allow quicker rebound may help. On a rough track it is hard to say exactly
                                            which type of shock package will work. There are two basic ways you can go.
                                            You can go with smaller pistons with lighter oil and stiffer springs so you
                                            have really quick rebound to try to work through all the bumps. Or you can
                                            go with bigger hole pistons with thicker oil and softer springs to try to
                                            make the car soak up all the rough. You'll have to try both to see which
                                            works best.</p>

                                        <p>No History of IFMAR would be complete without a brief reference to what
                                            actually led to the calling of the meeting in Geneva, where it was agreed
                                            that a World R/C Association should be formed.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Ted Longshaw took part in the first l/8th scale R/C car meeting to be held in
                                            England on Easter Monday 1971 and thereafter was involved with the formation
                                            of the BRCA in the U.K., along the way getting very enthusiastic about this
                                            exciting new hobby. This led to him taking part the next year in the ROAR
                                            Open National Championship at the Briggs Cunningham Museum in
                                            California.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Subsequently competing in the same Championships in '74 and '75, he tried to
                                            persuade some of the U.S. racers to come over to Europe, without success. He
                                            therefore suggested that he try to get some Europeans together to come and
                                            race in California in 1977, if such a race could be arranged. John Thorpe
                                            agreed that ROAR could use his raceway and Ted set about organizing the
                                            trip, through his position as President of EFRA.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;The first so called 1/8th World Championship therefore took place as
                                            arranged but, in truth, apart from the 20+ Europeans, the rest of the world
                                            was represented by ex-pats living in the U.S. It was suggested and agreed by
                                            everyone there that the next W.C. should be in Europe in 1979 and it was
                                            left to EFRA to arrange everything.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Meanwhile, Monaco wanted to hold a W.C. in 1978. As it had been agreed at the
                                            Thorpe Raceway that the next W.C. would be held in 1979, Monaco compromised
                                            with EFRA and agreed to hold a so-called World Cup. Several ROAR members
                                            came over and took part and went back to the U.S. with memories, not of the
                                            racing, but more of the liberated views of European women whilst sunning
                                            themselves at the poolside next to the track. (The pool you all have seen on
                                            the T.V. during the full-size Monaco G.P.). Cameras normally used to capture
                                            pictures of the latest modifications to cars, were all suddenly fitted with
                                            telephoto lens and pointed in a different direction.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;EFRA, meanwhile, decided that the application from the Geneva club in
                                            Switzerland to host the World Championship had the most merit and it was
                                            decided to hold the race there. Splendid pictures exist of the final of this
                                            event and, even now, there is no doubt that there were more spectators there
                                            than at any other R/C car race before or since!&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;Ted Longshaw called a meeting of all interested persons on the Monday
                                            morning immediately following the race with the idea of creating a
                                            world-controlling body that would not only establish uniform construction
                                            rules but would also ensure that there was only one World Championship that
                                            counted. (There were numerous clubs and organizations starting to advertise
                                            that their next race was to be a W.C. and, had this been allowed to
                                            continue, the whole prestige of a World Champion title would have been
                                            completely devalued.)&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;At the meeting, which was attended by many well-known names, such as
                                            Gene Husting (Associated), Ken McDowell (Parma), Keith Plested (PB Racing),
                                            Pieter Bervoets (Serpent), etc. - around 30 people in all, it was agreed
                                            that such an organization should be set up. South Africa's Wennie Bester
                                            suggested the name International Federation of Model Auto Racing and it was
                                            agreed. (It was a compromise to leave out any reference to R/C, as at that
                                            time, there was a possibility that the existing round the pole cable racers
                                            might want to join.)&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;It was agreed that W.C.'s should be held every two years and rotate
                                            alternately between the three blocs, i.e. it only came to your bloc once
                                            every six years. As there was effectively only one class then, it was
                                            thought that this would allow enthusiasts worldwide to meet every two years.
                                            I don't think that even the most optimistic manufacturer there thought that
                                            one day it would be as big as it is now and involve the worldwide travelling
                                            that is now necessary.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;Ted Lonsgshaw was proposed as President/Secretary by Gene Husting and
                                            IFMAR was born and on its way.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;To aid administration, it was suggested that it was made up of three
                                            equal voting parts, roughly speaking, Europeans, Americans and the Far East.
                                            Each would administer its own area and for W.C.'s would receive an equal
                                            allocation of 40 places. (There was only one class racing then, i.e. 1/8th
                                            I.C. circuit.)&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;Getting the Far East part of the equation to work proved quite a task
                                            and the original setting up of FEMCA is another full story in itself.
                                            Suffice it to say that it now works very well, with eleven member countries,
                                            all under the guidance of John and Marian Grant who really are quite
                                            indispensable.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;Originally, the only time everyone actually got together to hold a
                                            meeting was at the 1/8th W.C. Everyone was kept informed of what was going
                                            on by a regular monthly newsleltter sent out by the
                                            President/Secretary/Treasurer who, at that time, was a one-man committee.

                                        <p>&nbsp;WHAT HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY FROM INAUGURATION IN 1979 UNTIL 1996.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;1979</p>
                                        <p>1/8th World Championship in Geneva, (strictly speaking not yet really an
                                            IFMAR event, for IFMAR was not yet born), was won by Phil Booth from England
                                            driving a PB Racing car. Phil is now Development/Design Engineer with
                                            Schumacher and is responsible for many of the new ideas seen on these cars.
                                            He still retains his driving skills and recently was part of the Schumacher
                                            team taking part in the annual PARIS 24 hour race.&nbsp;</p>

                                            Greeno from England, also driving a PB.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>1981</p>
                                        <p>A 1/8th I.C. IFMAR World Championship was held in Indianapolis which was won
                                            by probably the only driver from the original 1977 race still capable to-day
                                            of making the A main at a World Championship, Arturo Carbonell. Art is now
                                            part of the Serpent organization in the U.S.A.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>1982</p>
                                        <p>First 1/l2th W. C. It had been decided to run this electric race in alternate
                                            years to the 1/8th I.C. Associated Electrics won and started their
                                            domination of Electric R/C racing W.C. titles.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>1983</p>
                                        <p>The 1/8th Circuit W.C., back in EFRA this year, was held at the Carnoux
                                            track, a superb purpose-built facility, now, unfortunately, no more. The
                                            race remains memorable now, more for the disputed result, (there was no
                                            electronic timing in those days) and the resultant Court case, than for the
                                            superb presentation of the whole event, which is a pity. IFMAR though
                                            learned something, especially the President, who ended up being sued in the
                                            French courts for approximately 250,000 pounds damages. This lesson resulted
                                            in the first version of the World Championship Contract, now refined several
                                            times, between the promoter and IFMAR. </p>
                                        <p>This dispute also has another interesting story in that it reinforced the
                                            determination of a young University scholar in Holland to perfect a way of
                                            automatically timing and counting the laps on R/C cars. He used the project
                                            as part of his studies to obtain his degree in Electronics. He is now
                                            responsible for the timing equipment used at almost every major motorized
                                            race you see on T.V. There may be advertisements showing various clock and
                                            watchmakers, but the signals that feed their equipment all come from the
                                            same source that originally started out trying to stop arguments at R/C car
                                            races about how many laps each car had achieved. This most successful of
                                            businessmen is Pieter Bervoets' brother, Fons.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>1984</p>
                                        <p>The first 1/10th Off-road W.C. Electric racing was now getting very big in
                                            the U.S.A. and this first event was held at the very heart of the most
                                            active area in the world at that time, Del-Mar, California. Associated
                                            Electrics were instrumental in helping this along and one began to hear more
                                            and more a name that is now a legend in R/C car racing and motor building in
                                            particular, Mike Reedy. Mike was asked to head up the Electric Section of
                                            IFMAR and served as Vice-President until last year. He played a big part in
                                            forming the rules that now govern all Electric racing, whatever scale, and
                                            is still part of the ROAR Executive.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>FEMCA, at the third attempt, was now up and running successfully and hosted
                                            its first W.C. event, the 1/8th track event in Tokyo. Mike Reedy, in his
                                            position as Vice-President of IFMAR, acted as Race Director and says he lost
                                            count of the number of approval dockets he signed during the race. Suffice
                                            it to say that it was a well-run race enjoyed by everyone who was lucky to
                                            be there.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>1986-1996</p>
                                        <p>World Championships continued, alternating each year. Bi-Annual General
                                            Meetings came and went, more countries joined. At the 1987 1/8th Race in
                                            Holland, EFRA pushed for a fourth non-voting to be formed, comprising
                                            countries outside the geographical areas of the existing blocs. In 1986, the
                                            first 1/8th I.C. Off-road W.C. was held in France and in 1992, at Ranch Pit
                                            Shop, California, the first 1/10th Electric Circuit W.C. was organized.
                                            There are now five different IFMAR W.C.'s (soon to be six with 1/10th I.C.)
                                            and Ted's original ideas, some of them incorporated in the first paragraphs
                                            of the Constitution, have been realized. The first clause, even today, is
                                            that IFMAR exists to promote international friendship. The other prime
                                            reason stated at the formation that there should only ever be one recognized
                                            World Champion of any particular class, has also been achieved. Without
                                            IFMAR, R/C car racing could have ended up like boxing with a myriad of
                                            titles, none of them recognized by everyone. As it is today, an IFMAR World
                                            Championship is truly just that. In 1995, at the Bi-AGM held at the 1/8th
                                            W.C. in Phuket, Thailand, Ted stepped down, was appointed Hon. Life
                                            President and handed over to the new President, John Grant and Marian Grant

                                        <p> Nitro engines aren't a plug and play deal like brushless power and because
                                            of that, time needs to be spent tuning and trouble shooting them in order to
                                            enjoy your time with them. These engines are very simple machines and don't
                                            require much to run. If it's getting air, fuel and spark, the engine will
                                            fire. But things don't always go smoothly and there will be times where you
                                            have to figure out what the engine is asking for in order for it to run
                                            correctly. These 10 tips are here to help you end the frustration and start
                                            up the enjoyment. </p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine won't start</strong></p>
                                        <p> Check to make sure that your glow starter is fully charged. You can quickly
                                            check by taking a new glow plug and plugging it into the end of the starter.
                                            If it glows, then it's charged and the problem is somewhere else. If it
                                            doesn't glow, then need to charge it or replace the battery and you should
                                            be good to go. If the glow starter isn't your problem then you might have a
                                            bad glow plug. Remove the glow plug from the engine and test it by plugging
                                            it into the glow starter. If all else fails, check to make sure you have
                                            fuel in the tank. Yes, that's something that people over look.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine starts but stalls right away</strong> </p>
                                        <p>OK, so you fire up your engine and it's running fine then the second you pull
                                            the glow starter off the heat sink head, the engine dies. This could be a
                                            sign of a glow starter that isn't fully charged or a glow plug that is one
                                            the edge of going bad. Start by putting your glow starter on charge or
                                            replacing the battery and try it again. If the problem still happens,
                                            replace your glow plug.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine runs on starter box but stops when vehicle hits the ground or
                                                when you tap the brake</strong> </p>
                                        <p>This is happening because there is something hanging up on the clutch and not
                                            allowing it to disengage from the drivetrain. So the second you stop the
                                            drivetrain in any way, the engine will die. The same thing happens when you
                                            hit the flywheel to shut the engine down. Remove the engine from the chassis
                                            and spin the clutch bell to see if there's any drag or if it's locked all
                                            together. If there's drag on the clutch bell, then you may have a clutch
                                            shoe or clutch spring hanging up. If the clutch bell is locked up all
                                            together, you have a bad clutch bell bearing. Replace both bearings even if
                                            only one clutch bearing is bad because chances are that the other one is on
                                            the same path.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine stalls when you hit the throttle</strong></p>
                                        <p> </p>
                                        <p>This is a sign that your high-speed needle is set to lean and the engine is
                                            starving for fuel. Simply richen the high speed needle a quarter turn and
                                            make fine adjustments from there to get it set properly.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine looses power when you hit full throttle</strong> </p>
                                        <p>This is a sign that your high-speed needle is set too rich. A sign is that
                                            the vehicle isn't as fast as it was when the engine had a proper tune and
                                            you'll see lots of smoke coming out of the pipe. Lean the high speed needle
                                            until your engine is running properly and at the correct temperature.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine struggles to move vehicle</strong></p>
                                        <p> Two things can be going on here. Your low-speed needle is set to rich or two
                                            lean. If you get on the throttle and your engine wants to die the second you
                                            touch it, your low speed needle is set to lean. If your engine is slow to
                                            react and stalls, then your low-speed needle is too rich. To check the
                                            condition of the tune on the low-speed needle, I like to do the pinch test.
                                            Drive the vehicle around if possible to clear it out and bring it over to
                                            you and immediately pinch the fuel line. You want the engine to run for a
                                            second or two before stalling out. If the engine dies right away, the
                                            low-speed is set to lean. If it takes longer, then your low-speed is set too
                                            rich. If you can't get the vehicle to run enough to clear the carburetor
                                            out, perform the pinch test to get a general idea of where you're at.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine runs too hot</strong></p>
                                        <p>An overheating engine can be caused by lack of air flow or a carb that is set
                                            to lean. Take a look at the body on your vehicle and make sure that there
                                            are venting holes in the windshield and behind the cab. Richen up the
                                            high-speed needle on the carb. A dirty engine can reduce the cooling
                                            capabilities of the engine and cause it to overheat. A tooth brush and some
                                            nitro cleaner will do a great job at removing any grime.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Fuel not reaching engine</strong></p>
                                        <p>If you are trying to fire up your engine and you see that the fuel isn't
                                            flowing to the carburetor, you have a clog in the fuel system. You can check
                                            the fuel tank by removing the pressure and fuel line from the pipe and
                                            engine. Once they are removed, you can blow into the pressure line and look
                                            to see if any fuel comes out the other. The fuel should flow with no effort.
                                            If it takes a lot of pressure to make the fuel come out or it doesn't come
                                            out at all, the fuel tank is clogged and needs to be replaced.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine runs erratically at idle</strong></p>
                                        <p>It can be frustrating when you can get the engine to idle consistently and
                                            that's because of an air leak in the engine or fuel tank. Check the tank for
                                            leaks by plugging the exhaust and fuel lines and submerging it in water.
                                            While under water, check for air bubbles. Another area where you can find an
                                            air leak is in the fuel lines. If you see bubbles flowing inside the fuel
                                            line or suspect that is where your air leak is coming from, replace the
                                            line. It's not expensive and needs to be done from time to time anyway. You
                                            can also take the engine apart and seal the back plate, carb, and high-speed
                                            needle assembly with O2 safe sealant.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Engine won't turn over</strong> </p>
                                        <p>Two things can keep an engine from turning over, too much fuel in the
                                            combustion chamber or a seized piston and or crankshaft. If your engine was
                                            turning over the suddenly locks up, chances are that you have a hydra lock
                                            condition where there's too much fuel in the combustion chamber. All you
                                            have to do to fix it is remove the glow plug and turn the engine over to
                                            blow out the excess fuel. If that's not the problem, then you'll be
                                            replacing parts or an entire engine if you have a seized condition.</p>
                                        <p> What is the ideal engine temperature?There are a lot of theories out there
                                            on what the best operating temperature for your engine. Some look for an
                                            engine temp of 230 some may recommend a higher temp. Before running any
                                            nitro engine, take a look at the owner's manual to see if there's a
                                            recommendation there. Ever engine is different and a temp that will work for
                                            one engine might not be ideal for another.</p>

                                                Correctly?</strong></p>
                                        <p> What exactly is our glow plug telling us.So you are wondering if you have rc
                                            nitro engine tuned correctly.You check your temperature on a regular basis,
                                            but you are still not sure.You can examine your glow plug to get a very good
                                            idea. Examining the glow plug is a peek inside the combustion chamber.But
                                            let's get the big picture and take the head button off, while leaving the
                                            glow plug installed in the head.What we are going to see by looking at the
                                            head button and the glow plug is the entire combustion process.This is going
                                            to show use just what is left after the burn process.By looking at the
                                            entire combustion chamber we can analyze what was happening during the
                                            burn.Let us explore a few different tuning examples below.</p>
                                        <p><strong> Running Rich:</strong></p>
                                        <p>Pictured above is an example of a <b>Rich Setting.</b><br> This is what your
                                            glow plug and head would look like after break-in.<br> The head and glow
                                            plug will be very wet with oil. Every thing still looks new.<br> No
                                            discoloring of the head, plug body or plug coil. If this is the look just
                                            after break-in that is great.<br> But, if this is post break-in then you are
                                            going to need to start leaning the engine out, to reach correct
                                            combustion.<br> If you run in a too rich state for a long period of time,
                                            oil will build up in the crank case and cause the front bearing seal to
                                            leak. </p>
                                        <p><strong>Running too Lean: </strong> </p>
                                        <p>The previous example is of a <b>Too Lean or Detonation Condition.</b>
                                            <br>Upon examining your head and glow plug you find or feel little or no oil
                                            residue.<br> The glow plug body is blued. The coil wire has broken away from
                                            the plug body.<br> You see that the combustion chamber is silver to slightly
                                            tan. Plus the head and glow plug are extremely pitted.<br> Your nitro engine
                                            is running too lean.<br> The pitting is caused by detonation. <br>Detonation
                                            is when the fuel air mixture pre-ignites in many different areas of the
                                            combustion chamber at one time.<br> The top of the piston will show the same
                                            kind of damage. If you see this kind damage you need to richen up your
                                            engine.<br> You may need to also shim your head. Increasing your head
                                            clearance will lower compression and lessen the possibility of detonation.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><strong>Running Borderline Lean: </strong> </p>
                                        <p>In the above example you can see why it is important to look at the head and
                                            glow plug together.<br> This example shows a <b>Borderline Lean with a Good
                                                Glow Plug.</b><br> By just looking at the glow plug you would think that
                                            your nitro engine tuning was correct.But, looking at the head you see that
                                            there is some pitting occurring.<br> With seeing this damage you know that
                                            your rc nitro engine is tuned too lean and you need richen your carberator
                                            setting some. </p>
                                        <p><strong>Perfer Tunning: </strong> </p>
                                        <p>If you are a serious racer, this is how your glow plug and head should
                                            look.<br> Above is an example of a <b>Perfectly Tuned Race Engine.</b><br>
                                            As you can see on this head and glow plug there is an even coloring across
                                            the combustion chamber and glow plug.<br> If you do a lot of racing this is
                                            the coloring you are looking for, that light brown to deep golden color.<br>
                                            This shows you that you are getting the most out of your engine. Your nitro
                                            engine tuning is producing maximum power and you have the perfect tune on
                                            your engine.<br> The only thing that you will need to do is keep your eye on
                                            is atmospheric conditions, temperature and humidity.<br> As these conditions
                                            change, so is the tune on your engine. So, always be aware of the weather
                                            conditions to help with your nitro engine tuning. </p>
                                        <p><strong>Running it safe:</strong> </p>
                                        <p>The previous example is of a nitro engine that has a <b>Safe Every Day
                                                Tune.</b><br> If your head and glow plug look likes this example and you
                                            are a novice racer or a basher, this is great.<br> You have done a great job
                                            of tuning your nitro engine.<br> The combustion chamber shows a little
                                            color, gold to tan.<br> Plus, the chamber and plug are still quite wet with
                                            oil residue.<br> The glow plug also shows some color on the body of the
                                            plug, grey to tan.<br> The coil wire will be shiny, silver and still have a
                                            new look to it.<br> The only place the coil wire should show some color is
                                            where it contacts the outer body of the plug.<br> At this point the coil
                                            wire should be slightly black.<br> This head and glow plug show an engine
                                            that is running great, a little on the rich side.<br> This type of tune on
                                            your nitro engine is very good to get the maximium life out of your
                                            engine.<br> Plus, this tune would be great for bashing and even for most of
                                            us weekend racers. <br> Taking the Mystery out of the Glow Plug </p>
                                        <p><strong>Running Lean: </strong> </p>
                                        <p>In this example we see a glow plug that has been run at a <b>Lean Setting</b>
                                            and has got very <b>Hot.</b><br> On inspection we see that the outer body
                                            has turned black.<br> The coil wire has a white dusty appearance.<br> Plus,
                                            the coil wire has small breaks in the electrode wire.<br> All of this is due
                                            to the very extreme heat of running lean.<br> This glow plug is near
                                            failure, the coil wire is close to breaking free of the body.<br> If the tip
                                            of the coil wire was to break off it could travel down into the engine
                                            causing severe damage to piston, bearings and head button.<br> But, most
                                            times when the coil wire does break off it will just go out an exhaust port
                                            causing no damage.<br> This will not always happen, if the coils wire stays
                                            inside the engine it will destory many internal components.<br> Not
                                            <b>COOL</b>.<br><br> I hope this has given you a little insight about nitro

                                            remember that this is not the big picture.<br> Take a few minutes to clean
                                            your engine thoroughly, remove the head button and take a close look at what
                                            is going on inside.

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>1. Engine Type - Know what type of engine you have. Is it a standard
                                                - or a turbo?</strong></p>
                                        <p>Standard engines (engines with a 1-piece head) are most common. Standard
                                            plugs are easily available, inexpensive and fit almost all standard engines.
                                            Standard plugs are installed with a washer, which creates a compression seal
                                            with the head.</p>
                                        <p>Many new engines are turbo engines, which feature a special 2-piece turbo
                                            head. The biggest benefit of turbo plugs is superior performance. Unlike
                                            standard plugs, turbo plugs (identified by a "P" in the description) feature
                                            a tapered "seat" that matches perfectly with the head that will creates a
                                            superior compression seal and with it, maximum efficiency and power. Turbo
                                            plugs are the choice for racers who want and need top performance.</p>
                                        <p>Caution : You should never install a turbo plug in a standard engine or vice

                                        <p><strong>2. Displacement -&nbsp;What size is your engine? Is it .12? .15?

                                        <p>Size matters to glow plugs. Big engines have more mass and retain heat
                                            better. Smaller, lighter engines don't, and need the help a hotter plug can
                                            offer. Therefore, the smaller the engine, the hotter the plug.</p>

                                        <p>High-nitro fuels produce more power than low-nitro fuels, but also produce

                                        <p>Smart modelers tend to keep a variety of glow plugs on hand. Simply because
                                            the "right" plug for your engine can change with the temperature. To achieve
                                            top performance, your choice of plug needs to change, too. Also, the hotter
                                            the day, use a colder plug.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>5. Other Considerations -&nbsp;A few other things you should
                                                know.</strong></p>
                                        <p>Hot plugs promote better idling and acceleration. If your engine runs rough
                                            or accelerates sluggishly, a hotter plug will help.</p>
                                        <p>Cold plugs produce more power and may improve performance if your engine runs
                                            hot. The downside is rougher idling and more difficulty in tuning.</p>
                                        <p>Where you run also plays a part. If the track/course has a lot of twists and
                                            turns, a hot plug is fine. If the track/course has long straights where
                                            you'll reach maximum rpm, a colder plug is best.</p>
                                        <p>Fuel-air mix not only affects how your engine performs; it can also have an
                                            impact on how long your plug lasts. If you run rich, it means that you're
                                            using more fuel than necessary for top performance. Modelers are often
                                            advised to run rich during engine break-in, because it helps cool the
                                            engine. However, running too rich can also cause an engine to "bog down" or
                                            quit entirely. In addition, it also means that the glow element is being
                                            exposed to more contaminants than necessary, which shortens plug life.</p>
                                        <p>Running lean means that you're using less fuel. "Leaning down" an engine has
                                            a positive effect on performance. However, care is needed here, because
                                            over-leaning an engine can harm it, by raising operating temperatures, "burn
                                            up" a plug before its time.</p>

                                        <p>Choosing the right glow plug not only improves performance, but can also
                                            extend the life of your engine and the glow plug itself. Here are a few more
                                            tips for you.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Airtight is Right</strong></p>
                                        <p>In order for an engine to idle, transition and tune consistently it must be
                                            airtight- airtight meaning that no air can enter the engine except through
                                            the carburetor intake. Surprisingly, even brand new out-of-the-box high-end
                                            engines can have air leaks and until these leaks are found and eliminated,
                                            the engine won't run consistently and cannot be precisely tuned. The good
                                            news is, several years ago I figured out an easy way to check for and fix
                                            air leaks. You'll need the following:</p>
                                        <p>• A small glass of soapy water</p>
                                        <p>• A small brush</p>
                                        <p>• About a foot of fuel tubing</p>
                                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Be sure that the high-speed needle is open at least
                                            two turns out and the throttle is at fully open.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Install one end of the fuel tubing on the carburetor
                                            nipple. You're going to be blowing into the other end of the tubing to
                                            pressurize the engine crankcase.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place your thumb over the carburetor intake to
                                            prevent air from escaping, then blow into the fuel tubing while brushing
                                            soapy water around the base of the carburetor, on both sides of the pinch
                                            bolt, around the fuel fittings, at the high and low speed needle valves,
                                            around the front bearing and even around the back plate.</p>
                                        <p>If any bubbling occurs you've got an air leak. But don't be alarmed. Fixing
                                            the leak is easy and your engine will run remarkably better and more
                                            consistently when you've eliminated these leaks.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>The Fix</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>&nbsp;Brushing soapy water around all possible air leak points while
                                                pressurizing the case will easily identify air leaks.</strong></p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;The most common air leaks seem to occur around the pinch bolt. Applying
                                            a dab of RTV (or silicon) over both exposed sides of the pinch bolt will fix
                                            this type of leak. RTV is also great for sealing any leaks around the base
                                            of the carburetor. Simply remove the carburetor and run a small amount of
                                            RTV around the base of the carb where the leak occurred. Reinstall the
                                            carburetor and allow the RTV to ooze out between the crankcase and the carb
                                            body. For leaks around the high-speed needle valve fittings, usually
                                            retightening the high-speed needle assembly will take care of these. Leaks
                                            directly at the high speed or low speed needle usually means there's a
                                            damaged O-ring that must be replaced. Many racers don't realize that the
                                            front bearing can leak air. That's why nearly every high-end engine uses a
                                            rubber sealed front ball bearing to not only keep out dirt, but also air. If
                                            your front bearing leaks air, it's time for a bearing replacement.</p>
                                        <p>This simple leak check can easily be done even when the engine is installed
                                            in a car. After you've done this test on several engines you'll be surprised
                                            of two things: first, how often unwanted air leaks occur and second, how
                                            much better your engine runs, idles and tunes when it's airtight. To run
                                            right it must be airtight!</p>
                                        <p><strong>Airtight Fuel system</strong></p>
                                        <p>The Fuel system must also be airtight. If the fuel tank, tank lid, fuel lines
                                            or filter has a leak then the same kind of tuning issues as described above
                                            will occur. While you can check the fuel system by using the same method of
                                            brushing soapy water onto the suspected offending area while blowing into
                                            the tank, I generally find it better to simply remove the tank from the car
                                            and submerse it in a sink of water while blowing into the vent line and
                                            plugging the fuel line. If bubbles are present you've got a leak.</p>
                                        <p>An engine at full throttle produces about 6 to 8 psi in the vent line and
                                            conversely in the tank. By blowing really hard you're also able to produce
                                            about 6 to 8 psi for a couple of seconds. If you're able to blow hard enough
                                            to cause the tank lid to open slightly and leak, it's time to replace the
                                            tank lid spring or bend more preload in the spring. The entire system (fuel
                                            tank, fuel filters, fuel lines, tank fittings, etc.) must be airtight to
                                            achieve consistent repeatable performance. I always that my fuel system is
                                            airtight when it's new but also recheck it every time I rebuild a car after
                                            a race. It easy insurance plus soapy water is a good way to thoroughly clean
                                            the tank. Just be sure it's totally dry before using it by flushing out any
                                            water left in the tank with fuel before installing it in you car.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The pinch test.</strong></p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Many racers find it difficult to properly tune the low speed needle. We've
                                            developed a method that makes it easy, even for beginners, to adjust the low
                                            speed needle to within 5% of peak performance and it's done right on the
                                            bench. We call it the pinch test and here's how it works.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your engine and warm it up for about 30
                                            seconds by revving the engine from idle to mid-throttle while holding the
                                            wheels off the ground.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Allow the engine to idle for 10 seconds. If the low
                                            speed needle tuning is so far off that it won't idle, simply bump the idle
                                            position higher until the engine will reliably run at a higher idle.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> With the engine at idle, pinch and hold the fuel
                                            line near the carburetor, cutting off the fuel flow and carefully listen to
                                            the engine rpm.</p>
                                        <p>If the low speed needle is set correctly, the engine should increase rpm only
                                            slightly and then die.</p>
                                        <p>If the engine increases several hundred rpm before dying, then the low speed
                                            needle is too rich and needs to be turned in.</p>
                                        <p>If the rpm doesn't increase at all and the engine simply dies, the low speed
                                            needle is set too lean and should be richened or turned out.</p>
                                        <p>After doing this a few times you'll get the hang of it, and tuning the low
                                            speed needle will become easy. The only way to get that last 5% performance
                                            on the low speed tune is through careful track testing. By evaluating the
                                            engine as it accelerates from a dead stop or out of slow corners during
                                            actual race conditions is the only way to get those last few percent of
                                            power from your engine. Variables like the clutch setting, gearing,
                                            traction, atmospheric conditions and even the car's weight will have an
                                            effect on this last 5% of tuning performance, and the optimum setting can
                                            only be reached by careful on-track tuning.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Fine Tuning in a Punch </strong></p>
                                        <p>On high traction tracks instant throttle response and acceleration are the
                                            keys to being competitive. To get that last 5% of performance thru tuning,
                                            many top drivers and engine tuners use the punch test. Here's how it works.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>With the high speed needle properly set and the low speed needle set per the
                                            pinch test above, run several laps at race pace to bring the engine up to
                                            temperature. Now stop the car at the beginning of the main straight and
                                            allow it to idle while you count to 15. At the count of 15, hit the throttle
                                            instantly full punch while carefully listening to the engine and note the
                                            rate of acceleration. If you did a good job with the pinch test above and
                                            the high-speed needle is properly set as described below, the car should
                                            rocket off the line with a powerful, crisp consistent engine sound. The
                                            trick here is to tune the low speed needle for even greater acceleration and
                                            an even crisper throttle response. Do this punch test several times until
                                            your very familiar with the acceleration rate (it helps to judge the amount
                                            of wheel spin) and the sound of the engine as it accelerates to full
                                            throttle. Now lean the low speed needle 1 hour (or 1/12th of a turn) and do
                                            the punch test again. Is the engine's acceleration rate and the crisp
                                            consistent sound better than in the previous test? Remember judging the
                                            wheel spin (the amount the wheels slip during heavy acceleration) is a good
                                            way to compare. If it's better or there's no change, lean the low speed
                                            needle 1 hour more and try the punch test again. At some point the engine
                                            will lean bog (hesitate) off the line during acceleration indicating that
                                            you've gone too far.</p>
                                        <p>When you finally find this point through repeated punch tests then leaning
                                            the low speed needle one hour each time, richen the low speed needle 2
                                            hours. This will be your engines peak setting giving maximum acceleration
                                            and throttle response for the specific conditions of the day. Just remember
                                            if you change anything, like gear ratios, clutch settings, exhaust systems,
                                            fuel, glow plugs and even changing atmospheric conditions like temperature
                                            and barometric will cause this optimum setting to change. Repeat the punch
                                            test often and especially just before a heat race to ensure maximum
                                            performance during the existing conditions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>The Dreaded Full Tank Lean Bog</strong></p>
                                        <p>If you've done much gas racing, you've probably encountered the dreaded lean
                                            bog that occurs right after a pit stop with a full tank of fuel. Right after
                                            the tank is filled, for about the next 3 or 4 laps the engine sags (lean
                                            bogs) when accelerating off of tight right-hand corners. On most tracks this
                                            happens when accelerating onto the straight. Seemingly, the lean bog
                                            magically goes away after a few laps but sure enough, after the next pit
                                            stop, it frustratingly returns-slowing lap times for several laps once
                                            again.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The key to eliminating full tank lean bogs is pressure
                                                tube position or adding a pressure reservoir as shown.</strong></p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>To solve this frustrating issue, it's important to understand what's causing
                                            it.</p>
                                        <p>Here's the scoop. As the throttle is released entering a turn, the pressure
                                            in the tank is now greater that the reduced pressure in the pipe. When the
                                            tank is full, some of the fuel sloshes up into the pressure line. The
                                            centrifugal forces encountered in a right hand turn further pulls the fuel
                                            into the pressure line, causing reduced pressure in the tank. When the
                                            throttle is cracked open to accelerate, the engine goes lean because of this
                                            reduced tank pressure and hence the dreaded lean bog occurs. The reason it
                                            only lasts for a couple of laps is first, as the fuel level goes down in the
                                            tank it's less likely to slosh as much into the pressure line and second, as
                                            the fuel level goes down there is a larger open space in the tank that's
                                            pressurized, maintaining adequate pressure long enough to prevent the low
                                            pressure lean bog problem. (If your exhaust system is mounted on the left
                                            side, as with some of the latest monster trucks, then this phenomenon will
                                            occur in left hand turns.)</p>
                                        <p><strong>The Fix</strong></p>
                                        <p>Keep the fuel out of the pressure line! That's sometimes easier said than
                                            done. We've had the most success by rerouting the pressure line so that as
                                            it come off the pressure nipple, the tubing goes to the right side of the
                                            fuel tank, then makes a loop on the right side of the tank. This prevents
                                            the centrifugal force of a right hand turn from filling the pressure tube.
                                            We've also had good success by adding one of the big reservoirs (they look
                                            like a big aluminum fuel filter and are available from Mugen or OFNA) in the
                                            pressure line. Many manufacturers, like Mugen and Serpent, recognize this
                                            problem and are making special pressure pickups and tank lids with large
                                            open volumes in the lid itself. You may have noted that many top drivers'
                                            cars have several loops of fuel tubing wrapped in their cars and wondered
                                            what was the purpose. Now you know. The key to fixing this issue is to
                                            experiment with pressure tube routing and, if necessary, installing a
                                            pressure reservoir in the pressure line.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Vapor Lock</strong></p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;<strong>Compressed CO2 sprayed directly onto the carburetor is a great
                                                way to prevent vapor lock during long main flame-outs.</strong></p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>If you've ever had your engine flame out after a reasonably long run and then
                                            found it nearly impossible to re-start, you may have experienced vapor lock.
                                            Vapor lock occurs most often in .12- and .15-size engines, especially when
                                            they're enclosed in a body with a 1/10-scale gas sedan or stadium truck.
                                            Vapor lock normally occurs after the engine is shut off. Heat from the head
                                            and combustion chamber transfers through the crankcase, heating the
                                            carburetor to the point that the fuel that reaches the carburetor through
                                            the fuel line boils off. This makes it impossible to start the engine
                                            because it's starved for fuel. The only way to get the engine to run is to
                                            cool the carburetor below the fuel's boiling point. If you're sport driving,
                                            you can simply wait 5 minutes for the carb to cool on it's own and then
                                            restart. If you're in the middle of an important long main, here are some
                                            creative ways racers have (including at the world championship level) cooled
                                            their carburetors preventing vapor lock:</p>
                                        <p>1. A bottle of compressed CO2 (or air like those that can be purchased to
                                            operate airbrushes) with a nozzle attached, allowing cold CO2 to be directed
                                            over the carburetor even when the body is in place. We've seen several
                                            top-level race teams use this CO2 method anytime the engine flames out to
                                            prevent the possibility of a vapor lock.</p>
                                        <p>2. By pulling the air filter and simply dumping fuel from the fuel bottle
                                            over the carburetor, usually bringing the temperature back to a tolerable
                                            level within a minute. Just be sure to avoid getting fuel on the brakes,

                                            adjust when your engine isn't running properly. When it's time to tune your
                                            engine, there's no substitute for plain old experience. Reading about engine
                                            tuning is helpful, but you need to experiment with your engine to improve
                                            your tuning skills. The good news is that the following tips will help you
                                            avoid some of the pitfalls of fine-tuning and achieve tuning proficiency

                                        <p><strong>BASE-LINE MIXTURE SETTINGS</strong></p>
                                        <p>Engine manufacturers often include base-line settings for the mixture
                                            needles, so it's wise to start with these. If this information is not
                                            provided, then you must arrive at needle settings that will get the engine
                                            started. A universal starting point is usually about 1 turn open
                                            (counterclockwise) on the low-speed needle and somewhere in the 2- to 3-turn
                                            range on the high-speed needle. This varies among engines, but it gets you
                                            started running, and then you can make the necessary corrections. After the
                                            initial startup, follow the proper break-in procedure, then worry about
                                            performance tuning!</p>
                                        <p>The proper sequence for adjusting the mixture needles is hotly debated. When
                                            you start to fine-tune the engine, it's generally best to start with the
                                            high-speed needle, then set the low-speed. First, however, get your engine
                                            running, and keep it running before you worry about race tuning.</p>
                                        <p>During break-in, the engine typically idles a long time, so it's best to
                                            adjust the low-speed setting first so the engine runs slightly rich (loading
                                            up every 30 seconds or so). It requires an occasional "blip" of the throttle
                                            to clear out any raw fuel that has accumulated in the engine. Once break-in
                                            is finished, then get the high-speed needle in the ballpark.</p>
                                        <p>Place the car on the ground and accelerate smoothly to give the engine a
                                            chance to build some heat. With the high-speed needle in the proper range,
                                            the engine should be able to rev relatively well up to full speed once it
                                            has been running for a few minutes on the track or parking lot.</p>

                                        <p><strong>FINE-TUNING</strong></p>
                                        <p>A word of caution first: there's a fine line between the perfect tune and a
                                            blown or damaged engine. Nitro-engine fuel also contains engine lubricant,
                                            so as you get close to dialing in the mixture to where there is just enough
                                            fuel to burn and deliver maximum power, you also are close to having just
                                            enough oil to keep the engine lubricated. Anyone with experience in tuning
                                            2-stroke engines can tell you that they run best right before they seize or
                                            blow up. Our engines are a little tougher and more capable of taking some
                                            abuse than bigger 2-strokes, but there's no sense in pushing the mixture
                                            settings so lean that you risk damage to the engine. I can't say this too
                                            often: get the engine up to full running temperature by running the car
                                            exactly as you would on the track or parking lot. The high-speed needle
                                            setting depends on the type of driving you do. I'll start with a racing
                                            setup.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>HIGH-SPEED NEEDLE</strong></p>
                                        <p>Racers will tune the high-speed setting to get from point A to point B as
                                            quickly as possible. (Performance also depends on a proper low-speed needle
                                            setting, but for now, let's concentrate on the high-speed setting.) The best
                                            place to race tune your engine is on the track where you run. I prefer to
                                            set the high-speed mixture so the car can leg out the track's longest
                                            straight section in the shortest time. Estimate the time by "feel" and gut
                                            instinct, or use a stopwatch for more accuracy. The high-speed mixture
                                            should be set to maximize engine performance for that particular track
                                            configuration. A short, tight track may require a main mixture setting just
                                            a shade on the lean side to provide maximum power out of the corners. You
                                            needn't be concerned about high-rpm performance because the track is too
                                            small for the engine to ever reach peak rpm. A long, high-speed track may
                                            require a slightly rich main-needle setting. If an engine constantly revs at
                                            the upper limits of the rpm range, the fuel mixture should be richened to
                                            ensure proper lubrication across the entire rpm range. This slightly rich
                                            setting might reduce bottom-end acceleration to a degree, but longer tracks
                                            require a slightly richer mixture setting to let the engine rev to its
                                            limits without running dry of fuel and oil.</p>
                                        <p>Why is it important to tune the engine to the track? A mixture needle can
                                            only provide optimum performance within a relatively narrow rpm range.
                                            Anywhere below this hypothetical rpm range, the engine runs slightly rich;
                                            anywhere above, it gets progressively leaner. Until we have fuel injection
                                            that constantly optimizes fuel mixture throughout the rpm range, there needs
                                            to be a degree of compromise with the mixture settings. So, ideally, set the
                                            mixture to provide the most power in an rpm range that is best suited to the
                                            track on which you run.</p>

                                        <p><strong>WIDE-OPEN RUNNING</strong></p>
                                        <p>Running in parking lots, particularly larger ones with a lot of breathing
                                            room, requires unique mixture settings. It's a common mistake to establish
                                            mixture settings for maximum punch as though the car will be run within the
                                            confines of a tight racetrack and then to go out and run at wide-open
                                            throttle (WOT) in a huge parking lot for 5 minutes. This type of running is
                                            incredibly unhealthy for an engine to begin with, and compounding the
                                            problem with an excessively lean main-needle setting is a recipe for
                                            disaster. If you still insist on torturing your engine, the high-speed
                                            mixture setting needs to be as much as 1/4 turn richer than typical to
                                            provide optimum fuel for the upper rpm range. The engine will be a little
                                            softer when accelerating from a standstill, but it's the only way to ensure
                                            there is an adequate supply of fuel and oil when running at the upper end of
                                            the rpm range. The inherent danger is that this type of running taxes the
                                            connecting rod and other engine components to their limits, but having the
                                            proper mixture setting will at least delay the inevitable.</p>
                                        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>LOW-SPEED NEEDLE</strong></p>
                                        <p>The high-speed needle is dialed in, so now let's properly set the low-speed
                                            needle. It's important to set it last because it simply regulates the fuel
                                            that flows from the main needle at low throttle settings. Lean out the main
                                            needle, and you automatically lean the low-speed needle as well. For this
                                            reason, it's wise to finish with the low-speed setting.</p>
                                        <p>Again, it's imperative for the engine to be at full operating temperature.
                                            There are many methods of testing the low-speed needle setting; one is to
                                            pinch the fuel line. When you pinch the fuel line, the engine rpm increase
                                            slightly. Keep pinching it, and the engine will eventually stall. If the
                                            engine rpm increase dramatically, it indicates that the low-speed setting
                                            may be too rich. Or, if the low-speed setting is already too lean, the
                                            engine rpm may not increase much at all, and the engine will stall rather
                                            quickly. It's a somewhat crude method and doesn't tell you what to expect
                                            from the engine on the track, but it will get you into the ballpark.</p>
                                        <p>Another common way is the "see-how-long-it-will-idle" method. The low-speed
                                            needle adjustment affects how long the engine will idle. A too lean fuel
                                            mixture causes the engine to race and possibly stall, limiting the duration
                                            of a steady idle. A too rich low-speed-mixture setting causes the engine
                                            idle to steadily drop and eventually stall. The ideal setting allows the
                                            engine to hold a smooth, steady idle for 10 to 20 seconds (max), and then
                                            the engine rpm decrease steadily because the crankcase loads up with fuel.
                                            Why? There are no awards given for the longest-idling engine. If the engine
                                            is able to idle steadily for a longer time, then it may start to lean out
                                            and heat up during a race and make it difficult to drive the car and keep
                                            the engine running. The only flaw in this method is that it doesn't tell you
                                            whether you have an artificially rich mixture to compensate for an idle
                                            speed that's too high.</p>
                                        <p>A common mistake is to set the idle-speed screw to keep the carburetor open
                                            too far. The low-speed needle must then be artificially rich to bring the
                                            idle down to a reasonable rpm. The symptoms are similar to a too rich
                                            low-speed-mixture setting; there's just a delay in the loss of engine rpm.
                                            How do you avoid this? This is also something that becomes easier with
                                            experience, but just continue to reduce the idle speed and lean the mixture
                                            until you know you can't go any further. Bottom line: adjust the idle-speed
                                            screw to suit the fuel-mixture setting, not the other way around.</p>
                                        <p>The simplest and most foolproof method to properly set the low-speed mixture
                                            is, again, to do it on the track. Set the low-speed needle so your car gets
                                            the strongest launch after sitting still for about 10 seconds. The engine
                                            should be able to pull strongly off the line without hesitation. A
                                            noticeable hesitation might be the result of either a rich or a lean
                                            low-speed mixture; knowing the difference takes experience, but look for
                                            signs that help point you in the right direction. How an engine decelerates
                                            can tell you as much as how it accelerates. If the engine spools down and
                                            rpm drops uncharacteristically low, it indicates that the low-speed-mixture
                                            setting is too rich. Or, if the engine takes too long to reach a steady idle
                                            and seems to want to keep revving, that tells you the low-speed-mixture
                                            setting is too lean. It can also indicate a lean high-speed-mixture setting,
                                            but that setting should have been addressed by properly setting the
                                            high-speed mixture first.</p>
                                        <p>It will take a little time to get it right. If you make small adjustments and
                                            are patient, you really can't do anything wrong. An adjustment you make in
                                            the wrong direction is reflected in engine performance; to correct the
                                            problem, simply go the other way.</p>

                                        <p><strong>CHANGING FUEL</strong></p>
                                        <p>Changing to a higher percentage of nitro fuel sounds like an easy method of
                                            developing more horsepower, but it isn't always that simple. Without getting
                                            into all the particulars of nitro fuel, I'll just say that there is a point
                                            where you can have too much nitro. Adding up to 10 percent more nitro than
                                            is typical produces more power, but you have to know how to adjust your
                                            engine to accommodate the extra nitro. Fuel-mixture settings need to be
                                            slightly richer when nitro content is increased. Also, you may have to
                                            increase head clearance by adding an extra head shim. The extra fuel
                                            introduced into the combustion chamber increases compression by adding
                                            non-compressible matter; this also increases cylinder pressure during the
                                            combustion process, which may cause detonation. Detonation occurs when the
                                            fuel explodes instead of burning, and that can cause internal engine damage.
                                            The extra head shim will likely prevent detonation when fuel with higher
                                            nitro content is used.</p>
                                        <p>A final note about fuel: fuel with a lower oil content (for manufacturers
                                            that actually disclose the amount of oil in their fuels) should be run with
                                            a richer mixture setting. This doesn't so much relate to performance as it
                                            does to the benefit of the engine. Conversely, fuels with higher oil content
                                            have the extra lubrication that allows a leaner mixture setting with less
                                            risk of engine damage. Fuels with a lower concentration of lubricant are
                                            intended for competition use by experienced engine tuners. These fuels will
                                            make marginally more power because the lubricant that's removed is replaced
                                            with power-producing nitro and methanol. Evaluate your tuning ability
                                            honestly before you run out to buy fuel with a lower oil content.</p>

                                        <p><strong>GLOW PLUG</strong></p>
                                        <p>A glow plug's temperature range is critical to proper performance.
                                            Small-block engines generally use warm to hot glow plugs, while big-block
                                            engines use plugs in the colder range. If you choose a plug in the wrong
                                            temperature range, you could be chasing the tune of your engine till the sun
                                            goes down. Changes of the relative temperature of the glow plug can be
                                            beneficial, however.</p>
                                        <p>A combination of compression, heat and a catalytic reaction between the
                                            platinum in the glow-plug coil and the methanol in the fuel creates
                                            combustion in a nitro engine. Altering the heat range of your glow plug can
                                            alter the timing of the combustion process. Nitro engines don't have an
                                            ignition system that can be used to advance or retard combustion timing, but
                                            a hotter plug that causes ignition a little earlier in the combustion
                                            process can have the same effect. "Advancing" the ignition timing can
                                            increase overall power output, especially at higher rpm. There are limits,
                                            however, and installing too hot a plug causes pre-ignition (detonation) and
                                            risks damaging your engine.</p>
                                        <p>It's a challenge to figure out a glow plug's temperature range. Manufacturers
                                            don't use a consistent and universal standard to rate the temperature ranges
                                            of their glow plugs. You will probably know the temperature of a plug
                                            relative to others within a given product line, but currently, no rating
                                            system allows comparisons among manufacturers. Here again, plain old
                                            experience with a variety of glow plugs will help you to know which are best
                                            for the effect you want.</p>
                                        <p>"Reading" the glow plug is a tuning technique advanced by Ron Paris. It
                                            suggests that looking at the glow plug tells you something about how your
                                            engine is running. The element in a glow plug will turn gray in an engine
                                            that is close to the optimum fuel mixture. This method requires a new glow
                                            plug, as the element will eventually turn gray regardless of the needle
                                            settings; the length of time it takes to turn gray is the issue. Plugs that
                                            turn gray in just a tank or two of fuel (running at race pace, not diddling
                                            around) indicate a fuel mixture close to ideal but also close to trouble. If
                                            the plug stays wet and shiny for a few tanks of fuel, you're in the safe
                                            zone; a little rich but safe. When the plug wire gets distorted or broken,
                                            however, you're in real trouble. It's a sure sign that the mixture is way
                                            too lean, or that there is too much compression and the engine is
                                            detonating.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>HEAD SHIMS</strong></p>
                                        <p>Engines are essentially air pumps. The engine takes air in, mixes it with
                                            fuel, and then the mixture is compressed and ignited. The additional
                                            pressure created by the burning fuel increases by a factor directly related
                                            to the amount of compression: increasing compression increases power output.
                                            But there are limits to the compression an engine tolerates. Too much causes
                                            the fuel mixture to combust too quickly, and that returns us to the same
                                            detonation scenario of an excessively hot glow plug.</p>
                                        <p>The amount of compression is determined by the number and thickness of the
                                            shims (gaskets) between the cylinder head and the top of the piston sleeve.
                                            Well, it's determined by many other factors, but the only one easily changed
                                            is the head clearance via head shims. More shims = less compression; less
                                            shims = more compression. Removing or replacing shims with thinner ones
                                            increases compression. Some engines have only one shim, so it isn't
                                            advisable to run without a shim at all. Moderation is the key. Go slowly,
                                            and make small, not drastic, changes that will minimize the risk of damage
                                            to your engine. First and foremost, be sure the piston won't hit the
                                            cylinder head if you remove a shim (or shims).</p>
                                        <p>You can also change compression with glow plugs. Some manufacturers make a
                                            longer glow plug that protrudes slightly into the combustion chamber,
                                            effectively reducing the area in which the fuel mixture is compressed. This
                                            area is already small, and the little extra space occupied by a longer glow
                                            plug will raise compression. This is not the most desirable method, but it
                                            can be used on engines that have only one thin head shim. It's unlikely that
                                            the longer plug will even come into contact with the piston, but just to be
                                            safe, check the head clearance before you install a long plug.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>WEATHER CONDITIONS </strong></p>
                                        <p>It's a simple fact: for optimum performance, you must retune your nitro
                                            engine every time you run it. Anyone who assumes that the needles can be
                                            left alone once they have been set is sadly mistaken. An overnight change in
                                            weather conditions may prevent an engine from running or may put it at risk
                                            of some damage if adjustments aren't made to the fuel-mixture settings.
                                            Ignoring an engine's tuning needs compromises its ability to make
                                            horsepower. In response to certain changes in weather, equipment and other
                                            variables, nitro engines must be regularly retuned.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hot weather requires a leaner mixture setting;
                                            cold weather requires a richer setting. Most people assume the opposite
                                            because they treat the mixture needle like a thermostat. It is wrong to
                                            assume that colder weather requires a leaner setting to keep heat in the
                                            engine and vice versa. Cold air is denser than hot air. The denser, colder
                                            air packs more oxygen into the engine, so going from hot weather to cold
                                            needs a commensurate increase of fuel to balance ratio of fuel-burning
                                            oxygen and the fuel itself. The opposite is true in hotter weather. Going
                                            from cold to hot weather requires a leaner mixture setting.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Humidity:</strong> Humidity is the amount of moisture (water vapor)
                                            in the air. Moisture in the air takes up volume that would otherwise be
                                            occupied by fuel-burning oxygen. Less oxygen means less fuel is required to
                                            maintain a proper ratio of air and fuel. High humidity requires a leaner
                                            mixture setting than dry conditions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Barometric pressure:</strong> A barometer measures the atmospheric
                                            pressure (generally listed in the local newspaper or on the local weather
                                            forecast on TV). Higher barometric pressure readings mean more air is
                                            getting into the engine, requiring a richer mixture setting to balance the
                                            air/fuel ratio.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Altitude:</strong> &nbsp;Altitude is an important factor that most of
                                            us ignore, yet it affects the engine's performance possibly more than any
                                            other element. The general formula for power loss with increases in altitude
                                            is 3 percent for every 1,000 feet above sea level. If you race in Colorado
                                            at 5,000 feet instead of in California at sea level, you can expect to lose
                                            about 15 percent of the engine's potential power output, if the engine is
                                            tuned properly.</p>
                                        <p>Air is thinner at higher altitudes, which means there's less fuel-burning
                                            oxygen than at sea level. You might sense a common theme here: less air
                                            (oxygen) means less fuel to maintain the proper air/fuel ratio. So, running
                                            at higher altitudes requires a leaner mixture setting than running at sea
                                            level.</p>

                                        <p><strong>TUNED PIPE AND HEADER</strong></p>
                                        <p>Anyone who has been around 2-strokes knows that the exhaust system plays a
                                            major role in engine performance. Pipes and how they affect performance is a
                                            complete article in itself. I don't want to get into the science of tuned
                                            pipes here, I'll simply suggest that volume (assuming the pipe doesn't stray
                                            too far from convention) determines where the pipe will go to make the best
                                            power. Smaller pipes with lower overall volume make the best top-end power,
                                            while the fatter, longer pipes with greater volume provide the best
                                            bottom-end punch. Selecting the proper tuned pipe can have a very noticeable
                                            impact on your application.</p>
                                        <p>Headers can be modified by almost any enthusiast. The length of the header is
                                            important to squeezing more power out of your engine. Longer headers deliver
                                            better bottom-end power, while shorter headers make better top end. Shorten
                                            a header by cutting it with a hacksaw or a Dremel tool. Cut it in 1/8-inch
                                            increments, and measure the performance to determine whether any improvement
                                            has occurred. Continue cutting until performance levels off. If you need to
                                            add back on to the length of the header because you've cut too much and
                                            performance is suffering, simply increase the gap between the header and
                                            pipe, but don't expose more than 1/4 inch of coupler. If the header is too
                                            short by greater than 1/4 inch, just get a new one.</p>

                                        <p><strong>CLUTCH</strong></p>
                                        <p>I've spent lots of time trying to chase away a nasty bog in the engine as it
                                            came off the line or out of a corner, only to find later that the problem
                                            was the clutch. Some clutches are built properly at the factory, but in my
                                            experience, most engage too early, which hobbles the engine coming out of
                                            every corner. Tuning the clutch to engage at the proper rpm puts more power
                                            to the ground than most could imagine.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>TEMPERATURE GAUGE</strong></p>
                                        <p>You'll notice that I have not once mentioned a temperature gauge. The worst
                                            thing you can do is to tune an engine to run at a specific temperature.
                                            Engine temperature is affected by a number of factors, only one of which is
                                            fuel mixture. Weather and many other factors play a role in engine
                                            temperature, so tuning to run at the same temperature every time
                                            shortchanges the engine's potential to make power. Yes, most engines run in
                                            the 200- to 300-degree range, so checking that the engine stays within this
                                            range is valuable to a certain extent. As a result of different weather
                                            conditions and other variables, however, the same engine when tuned for peak
                                            power output can vary as much as 50 degrees. A temp gauge is a reference
                                            tool that you should use only to build a data bank of tuning information. A
                                            temp gauge should not be used as a tuning tool. Don't tune an engine to run
                                            at 230 degrees all the time. Prevailing conditions may require a mixture
                                            setting that causes the engine to make maximum power while running at 270
                                            degrees. You'll never know that if you always target the same temperature.

                                        <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
                                        <p>Engine tuning is not a black art; it just takes time to learn the particulars
                                            so you can maximize your power plant's performance. Take the time to read
                                            and learn, and you will avoid the mistakes most of us made in learning the
                                            ropes. I thought I had it licked 10 years ago, but I'm still learning. We
                                            never really stop learning; sometimes, we just get too smart for our own
                                            good. Experiment a little with some of the tips, and you'll find there's
                                            more power to be made with less effort than you thought. Some of the
                                            modifications involve a bit of risk; just take it slowly, and use your
                                            "noodle." It's hard to make a mistake you can't correct.</p>

                                        <p>There are many different types of batteries that you can use for example NiCd

                                        <p>1. They have roughly twice the capacity of a NiCd battery</p>
                                        <p>2. They are more expensive, because of the exotic material.</p>
                                        <p>3. Almost all contain a tiny controller chip embedded in each battery that
                                            adjusts how quickly they discharge and prevents overcharging.</p>
                                        <p>4. They require a different charger.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Li-Poly's</p>
                                        <p>1. They are extremely light weight.</p>
                                        <p>2. They are capable of providing nearly twice the power as a Li-ion battery.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>3. They can easily be shaped differently to fit into many different nooks and
                                            crannies.</p>
                                        <p>4. They do require a special charger.</p>
                                        <p>5. They are very dangerous if overcharged. So extreme caution needs to be
                                            used while charging. But, the new charging systems addressing this problem.

                                        <p>6. They are more expensive.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>I know all this so far is boring, you just want to know what RC car battery
                                            is best for you.</p>
                                        <p>What do all those numbers on each cell or pack mean. The numbers are the
                                            batteries Milliamp Hour (mAh) rating.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>A Milliamp is 1/1000th of a Amp Hour (Ah). So a battery with a 1500 mAh is
                                            equal to 1.5 Ah. This is the easiest way to distinguish a batteries strength
                                            or capacity.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>So, a battery with a larger mAh rating has a larger capacity. Thus, how long
                                            the battery will last before recharging is needed.No matter what the mAh
                                            rating is the voltage stays the same. A good way to understand voltage, is
                                            it is the pressure of the electric current.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>A better way to understand this is think of your RC car battery as a gas
                                            tank.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Voltage is how much gas is being used and mAh is the size of the gas
                                            tank.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>So, choosing your RC car battery and RC car battery packs can be a critical
                                            decision for you to make.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>No matter what type of RC truck or car you have. They all need batteries.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>You need to have them for your remote control transmitter, receiver, electric
                                            motor, glow plug starter and starting system (roto starter or starter box).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Batteries are a large investment for you to make. So, learning to maintain
                                            them is a very important item in enjoying your RC trucks and cars.</p>

                                        <p>Understanding your r/c nitro engine carburetor is very important.</p>
                                        <p>Learning how to adjust your carburetor to critical in getting your r/c nitro
                                            engine to perform correctly.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Note: Tuning the needle Clockwise is lean and Anti-clockwise is rich..</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Adjusting the Low Speed Needle (LSN) (The one coverd with the rubber boot,
                                            the place your serov links) Adjust tilll you are happy with the initial
                                            pickup. Too lean will result in mild or no smoke &amp; will accelerate like
                                            a rocket.&nbsp;Once adjusted, all future adjustments should be on the HSN
                                            only..</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Adjusting the high speed needle (HSN) (the Gold color) is the screw that
                                            either lean's or richen's your nitro fuel mixture entering the r/c nitro
                                            engine.Adjusting this needle controls the temperature your engine is running
                                            at. Plus, it affects the overall performance of your r/c nitro
                                            engine.&nbsp;Too some degree adjusting your high speed needle can change how
                                            your engine idles. It can be an art or science getting your r/c nitro engine
                                            carburetor adjusted properly.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Be patient and only do adjustments in small increments. A 1/16th to 1/4th of
                                            a turn. Usually start at a 1/16th of a turn and see how that works and keep
                                            adding a 1/16th of a turn till I reach the tune that suits me.</p>
                                        <p>So do take your time and keep notes on what adjustments you are making.&nbsp;
                                        </p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>One other tuning factor that affects your r/c nitro engine is the carburetor
                                            restrictor.</p>
                                        <p>Depending on which r/c nitro engine you have you will more than likely have
                                            two or three restrictors included with your engine.</p>
                                        <p>The sizes of these restrictors will be from small, medium to large.</p>
                                        <p>The actual millimeter size will vary depending on the size and manufacture of
                                            your r/c nitro engine carburetor.</p>
                                        <p>The restrictor you use will depend on your driving style and how you have
                                            your engine tuned.</p>
                                        <p>Just remember that changing the restrictor will require you to re-tune your
                                            r/c nitro engine carburetor.</p>
